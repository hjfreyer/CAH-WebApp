Web-app for Inhumane Card Games (2014-09-24)

# Backend
TODO(sdbrody): Document setting up the environment.

# Frontend
The frontend is written in Dart. Once built, it's a totally static SPA which can
be hosted wherever.

## Setup

Building requires the following:
* npm
* The Dart SDK.
* Dartium (optional, but recommended).

After checking out, cd to the "frontend/" directory and run `npm install`. If
you're encountering build problems/missing resources after a pull, you might try
running `npm install` again.

## Running the debug server
`npm run serve`

Then open http://localhost:8080, preferably in Dartium.

## Building and deploying
